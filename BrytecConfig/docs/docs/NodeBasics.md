# Node Basics


Nodes may have any number of inputs, outputs, or values. Inputs are shown by connection circles on the left hand side.
Outputs are shown by connections on the right hand side. Values have no connection circles.
Drag from a node connection circle to another to connect nodes and transfer values to the next node. 

###### Node Errors

You must make sure that you don't form a loop in a node group or it will cause and error, indicated by the node turning red.
